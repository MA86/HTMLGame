Some tradeoffs to consider:
	PROBLEM: Too many files == too many GET requests.
	SOLUTION: In DEVELOPMENT create many files to organize. In PRODUCTION, put everythin in
		  ONE file and minify it, then deploy.

    // FUTURE TODO: 
    // implement "Animated Background" if possible, instead of static picture.
    	// Careful though, running it like sprites can eat lots of memory.
    	// Instead use efficient techniques to do this type of animation, like changing
    	// pixels in png to simulate starry night! or 'localized' animation.
    	// Read up scrolling background too. (aka parallax)

    // TODO:
    // Learn 'signals'
