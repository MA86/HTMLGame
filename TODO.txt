Some tradeoffs to consider:
	PROBLEM: Too many files == too many GET requests.
	SOLUTION: In DEVELOPMENT create many files to organize. In PRODUCTION, put everythin in
		  ONE file and minify it, then deploy.

    // TODO: implement "Animated Background" if possible, instead of static picture.
    // Careful though, running it like sprites can eat lots of memory.
    // Instead use efficient techniques to do this type of animation, like changing
    // pixels in png to simulate starry night! or 'localized' animation.
    // Read up scrolling background too. (aka parallax)

    // TODO: READINGS before proceeding further
    // Finish reading techniques for seperating game layers!
        // Once research and reading is done, then code a simple workable
        // example.
    // Research bullet systems.
    // Learn 'signals'
    
    // Bring back networking.

    // turn turret body into signal, place it on tank position, see what happens
